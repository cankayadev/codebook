## [42-projects](https://github.com/cankayadev/codebook)
- My solutions for subjects at the Coding school Ecole42 in Wolfsburg ([42Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de/de/42-programming-curriculum/))
- Mostly written in C and Cpp
- Formatted according to the beautiful [42 Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf)

Todo: 
- [ ] Create a directory for Puppeteer scripts and push them 
- [ ] Make a nice README.md
